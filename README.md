Kubernetes the Hard Way on Vagrant
==================================

Building on [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/README.md), this automates the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Vagrant on your local machine.

It's all automated, but you can learn the process by typing in each command, step by step:

```
sudo pip install shutit
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ianmiell/shutit-k8s-the-hard-way
cd shutit-k8s-the-hard-way
./run.sh --training
```

Here is a video of the above training:
